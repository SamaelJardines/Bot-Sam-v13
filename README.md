## About

This project is no longer supported and i upload it to see the progress of my javascript learning, it is not in English because my native language is Spanish, but i am starting to do everything in English and start documenting in English, i did not comment on this code because i did it at the end of 2021 and i didn't have the learning that I have now, the project code also has errors and it's not the best written, but i'm working on updating it to v14 where i'm doing everything in English, i commented on it in English and i made the cleanest code i've ever made.

Any project I do will do it just as clean and commented as v14 of this project.
